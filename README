How to choose a browser for displaying the Online Help?
-------------------------------------------------------

By default xfce-utils uses mozilla to display the online help. You might
want to use another browser to display the help. To do so, you can
either add --with-browser=<my-favourite-browser> to configure or you
can set the BROWSER environment variable to your favourite browser
prior to running startxfce4, e.g. in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.
