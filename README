How to choose a browser for displaying the Online Help?
-------------------------------------------------------

By default xfce-utils uses mozilla to display the online help. You might
want to use another browser to display the help. To do so, you can
either add --with-browser=<my-favourite-browser> to configure or you
can set the BROWSER environment variable to your favourite browser
prior to running startxfce4, e.g. in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.


What is this --enable-gtkhtml option good for?
----------------------------------------------

If you have libgtkhtml2 installed, you may want to use it to have nice
looking HTML info pages in the about dialog instead of the plain text
ones. Give it a try.


What about Xinerama/XRandR support in xftaskbar?
------------------------------------------------

The Xinerama and XRandR X extensions are highly incompatible, that says
you can only use one of them at a time. xftaskbar first checks if Xinerama
is used on the display and if so, it will not make use of the XRandR
extension.
