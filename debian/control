Description: Various tools for XFce
 This package contains xfbd4, xfbdmgr4, xfmouse4, xfrun4 and xftaskbar4,
 five tools for xfce, the main panel of XFce project. Xfce, previously 
 known as Xforms cool environment, is a desktop environment reminiscent 
 of CDE that uses the GTK+ library and isn't resource-hungry.
 .
 You should only install this package if you intend to use Xfce4.
 Otherwise, installing it does hardly make sense.
