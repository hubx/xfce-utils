  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>
    This document gives an overview of the Xfce Desktop Environment and explains
    how to perform several common tasks. It is meant to be a starting point for 
    anyone who wants to use Xfce and it includes pointers to other sources of 
    information.

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for unix-like operating
    systems. It aims to be fast and light on system resources, while still 
    being visually appealing and easy to use.
  </para>

  <para>
    Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and 
    re-usability. All of Xfce's core components can be build and installed 
    separately. Xfce 4 is based on the 
    <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org" type="html">GTK+ toolkit</ulink> version 2.
  </para>

  <para>
    Adhereance to standards is one of the main design goals of Xfce 4, 
    specifically those defined at 
    <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org" type="html">Freedesktop.org</ulink>.
    This allows Xfce 4 to seamlessly interoperate with programs written for 
    other desktop environments that follow these specifications.
  </para>

  <para>
    Xfce is all free software. The separate components are released under either
    the BSD license, the GNU LGPL or the GNU GPL (see 
    <xref linkend="xfce4-copyright"/> for details).
  </para>

    <para>
      If you are looking for specific information about Xfce 4, chances are you
      can obtain it from one of the resources in this list:

  <title>Using Xfce4</title>

  <sect2 id="xfce4-getting-started">
    <title>Getting started</title>

    <para>
      Use <application>startxfce4</application> to start an Xfce session, which
      includes the session manager, the panel, the window manager and the 
      desktop manager.
    </para>

    <para>
      By default the Xfce session manager manages the startup of applications. 
      It allows you to save your session when you quit Xfce, so that the next 
      time you log in, the same applications will be started for you 
      automatically.
    </para>

    <para>
      To customize the behaviour of <application>startxfce4</application>, 
      copy the file <filename>${sysconfdir}/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc</filename> to 
      your personal <filename role="directory">~/.config/xfce4/</filename> 
      directory and edit that file.  Depending on your installation method the 
      location of the system <filename>xinitrc</filename> file may be 
      different. If you install from source, 
      <filename role="directory">${sysconfdir}</filename> defaults to 
      <filename role="directory">/usr/local/etc/</filename>. For binary 
      packages it is often set to 
      <filename role="directory">/etc/</filename>, 
      <filename role="directory">/etc/X11</filename>,
      <filename role="directory">/usr/pkg/etc</filename> or
      <filename role="directory">/usr/X11R6/etc</filename>;
      you can use your package manager to find out.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="default-desktop">
    <title>The Default Desktop</title>

    <para>The Xfce Desktop Environment is not a single entity that provides all 
      funtionality, but rather it tries to adhere to the old UNIX tradition of 
      small tools that do one job and do it well. A default Xfce desktop with no 
      applications running is shown in <xref linkend="default-session-fig"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      When you run <application>startxfce4</application> for the first
      time, several applications are started by the Xfce session manager:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Panel</term>
	<listitem>
          <para>
            In a default session there is a full width panel at the top of the 
            screen and a smaller one at the bottom. The 
            <application>xfce4-panel</application> application manages all 
            panels on the screen.
          </para>
	  <para>
            The top panel shows a graphical pager with a miniature view of all
            workspaces, a task list showing all applications running on the 
            current workspace and a system tray to show status icons that are 
            used for example by some media players or instant messaging 
            applications.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            The bottom panel contains several application launchers and a clock.
            You can right-click on any panel item to get a menu that allows you 
            to change its properties, add or remove new items or to change the
            properties of the panel itself.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            For more information, have a look at the 
            <ulink url="xfce4-panel.html" type="html">panel manual</ulink>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Desktop Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
            The desktop manager provides the desktop background image and two 
            menus when you click on the desktop background. Optionally, it can 
            show icons on the desktop, either for minimized applications or for 
            files in the <filename>~/Desktop</filename> folder.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            The right mouse button opens a menu that allows you to start 
	    applications. Look at the 
            <ulink url="xfdesktop.html" 
	           type="html">manual</ulink> to find out how to change the 
            menu contents.
	  </para>
	  <para>The middle mouse button (or Shift + left click) opens a list of
	    all applications that are currently running. You can activate an
	    application by clicking on its menu entry.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Window Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The window manager is responsible for placing the windows on
	    the screen and provides the window borders and decorations. It
	    allows you to move windows around by draggin the titlebar and
	    provides title bar buttons, for example to close, minimize or
	    maximize a window. Look at the 
            <ulink url="xfwm4.html" type="html">manual</ulink> for a full 
            explanation of the window manager settings.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Settings Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
            The settings manager runs in the background and makes sure that all
            Xfce applications update their settings when the user changes 
            something in the settings manager dialog (see following section) and
            it takes care of reading the configuration from disk at startup. 
            Have a look at the <ulink url="xfce-mcs-manager.html" 
            type="html">Settings Manager</ulink> and <ulink
            url="xfce-mcs-plugins.html" type="html">Settings Plugins</ulink>
            manuals for a full explanation of the settings manager.

      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="common-tasks">
    <title>Common Tasks</title>

    <para>This section will explain how to perform several common tasks to 
      quickly get you started working with Xfce 4. Because that is what
      Xfce 4 is designed for, to allow you to get work done.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="common-run-programs">
      <title>Running programs</title>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Xfce Panel</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The panel is designed to allow quick access to the most
	      frequently used applications by putting them on the main panel.
	      Less often used applications can be put in a launcher menu.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Desktop Menu</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Another method for starting applications is from the desktop
	      mouse menu. Read the <ulink url="xfdesktop.html"
              type="html">Desktop Manager manual</ulink> for
	      information on how to change the menu contents.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Run Dialog</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              If you know the name of a program and it is not on the panel
	      or in the desktop menu you can use the run dialog. To open the
	      dialog type <keycap>Alt+F2</keycap> or choose the <guilabel>Run
	      program...</guilabel> option from the desktop menu.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              The dialog will remeber the 10 last commands that were
	      executed successfully.
	    </para>

    <sect3 id="common-managing-windows">
      <title>Managing windows and workspaces</title>

      <variablelist>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Basic window operations</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You can move windows around the screen by dragging their
	      title bar. A window can be closed, hidden, maximized, shaded and
	      made sticky &mdash; this means it will show up on all workspaces
	      &mdash; by using the title bar buttons.
	    </para>
	    <para>Right clicking on the title bar will open a menu that gives
	      access to all window operations.</para>
	    <para>Shading a window, which means collapsing it to only show the
	      title bar, can also be accomplished by using the mouse wheel
	      over the title bar. Mouse wheel up is shade, mouse wheel down 
              is unshade.
	    </para>
	    <para>If you want maximized windows to not cover the entire screen
	      you can set workspace margins from the settings manager dialog
	      (see below).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Application management</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>To find out what applications are currently running you can
	      look at the task list on the top panel. Clicking on a button in 
              the task list will focus the associated application. Clicking 
              again will hide it.
	    </para>
	    <para>When you click with the middle mouse button on the desktop 
	      background a list of windows is shown, ordered by workspace. 
	      You can activate the application or change workspaces by 
	      choosing the appropriate menu entry.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Workspaces</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You can change workspaces by clicking on them in the
	      graphical pager, either on the taskbar or on the panel. Pressing 
	      <keycap>Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow</keycap> or
              <keycap>Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow</keycap> will cycle through the
	      workspaces. Using the mousewheel over the pager or the desktop
	      background has the same effect.
	    </para>
	    <para>To add or remove workspaces you can use the middle click
	      desktop menu or the settings dialog (see below).

    <sect3 id="common-settings">
      <title>Using the settings manager dialog</title>

      <para>The settings manager dialog provides access to the global

	<application>xfce-setting-show</application>.
      </para>

      <para>Dialogs to change many aspects of the Xfce Desktop Environment are 
        available. See the separate manuals of the Xfce components for more

    </para>

    <para>Building the packages should be a simple matter of unpacking the
      tarballs and, from the top source directory, typing:
    
<programlisting>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</programlisting>

      Some package will have extra configure options available. You can find 
      them by typing <command>./configure <option>--help</option></command>.
    </para>

    <para>Xfce &appversion; depends on pkg-config and GTK+ >= 2.6. If you 
      installed these from a binary package, make sure you have the 
      corresponding <filename>-dev</filename> packages installed as well.
    </para>

    <para>Optionally you can install librsvg >= 2.2, for SVG icon support, 
      libstartup-notification, to have a busy cursor when loading applications
      that support this standard and dbus for enhanced functionality, mainly in 
      Thunar and xfdesktop.
    </para> 

    <para>If you install into a different prefix from pkg-config, you have to
      set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to include the path to the *.pc files
      installed by the Xfce 4 libraries, which is ${prefix}/lib/pkgconfig. For
      example:
    </para>

<programlisting>export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig</programlisting>
