  <para>
    This document gives an overview of the Xfce 4 Desktop Environment and
    explains how to perform several common tasks. It is meant to be a starting
    point for anyone who wants to use Xfce 4 and it includes pointers
    to other sources of information.

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for unix-like operating
    systems. It aims to be fast and light on system resources, while still 
    being visually appealing and easy to use.
  </para>

  <para>Xfce 4 embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and 
    re-usability. All of Xfce 4's core components can be build and installed 
    separately. Xfce 4 is based on the <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org" 
      type="html">GTK+ toolkit</ulink> version 2. 
  </para>

  <para>Adhereance to standards is one of the main design goals of Xfce 4, 
    specifically those defined at <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org" 
      type="html">Freedesktop.org</ulink>. This allows Xfce 4 to seamlessly
    interoperate with programs written for other desktop environments that
    follow these specifications.
  </para>

  <para>Xfce is all free software. The separate components are released under
    either the BSD license, the GNU LGPL or the GNU GPL (see <xref 
      linkend="xfce4-copyright"/> for details).
  </para>

  <sect2 id="xfce4-getting-started">
    <title>Getting started</title>

    <para>Use <application>startxfce4</application> to start an Xfce session,
      which includes the session manager, the panel, the taskbar, the window 
      manager and the desktop manager. 
      All programs (or symbolic links to programs) in 
      <filename>~/Desktop/Autostart/</filename> will be run on startup (note
      that this directory does not exist by default and you may have to create
      it).
    </para>

    <para>By default the Xfce session manager manages the startup of
      applciations. It allows you to save your session when you quit Xfce, so
      that the next time you log in, the same applications will be started for 
      you automatically.
    </para>

    <para>
      To customize the behaviour of <application>startxfce4</application>, 
      copy the file <filename>${sysconfdir}/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc</filename> to 
      your personal <filename role="directory">~/.config/xfce4/</filename> 
      directory and edit that file.  Depending on your installation method the 
      location of the system <filename>xinitrc</filename> file may be 
      different. If you install from source, <filename
      role="directory">${sysconfdir}</filename> defaults to <filename
      role="directory">/usr/local/etc/</filename>. For binary packages
      it is often set to <filename role="directory">/etc/</filename>;
      you can use your package manager to find out.

    <title>The Default Desktop</title>

    <para>The Xfce 4 Desktop Environment is not a single entity that provides
      all funtionality, but rather it tries to adhere to the old UNIX
      tradition of small tools that do one job and do it well. A default 
      Xfce 4 desktop with no programs running is shown in 
      <xref linkend="default-session-fig"/>.

    <para>When you run <application>startxfce4</application> several
      applications are started by the session manager:
    </para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Taskbar</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>At the top of the screen you will see the taskbar. It shows
	    the applications running on the current workspace. You can
	    focus the application by clicking on the button in the taskbar.
	    Clicking again will hide the application. If you use the right
	    mouse button, a menu will appear, allowing you to perform several 
	    actions on the application window. 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The taskbar can optionally contain a graphical pager showing a 
	    miniature view of all your workspaces and a notification area or 
	    system tray. 
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Panel</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>At the bottom of the screen is the Xfce4 panel. It allows you
	    to run applications and also contains a graphical pager, a clock
	    and a mail checker. Some items have an associated panel menu that
	    gives access to more applications. Panel menus are opened by
	    pressing the small arrow buttons next to the panel item.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Changing the content of the panel and the properties of the items
	    is done by using the right mouse button. Both the panel items and
	    the panel move handles have a right-click mouse menu from where
	    you can chage the panel configuration. For more information look
	    at the <ulink url="xfce4-panel.html" type="html">panel
	      manual</ulink>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Desktop Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The desktop manager provides the desktop background image and
	    two menus when you click on the desktop background.
	  </para>
	  <para>The right mouse button opens a menu that allows you to start 
	    applications. Look at the <ulink url="xfdesktop.html" 
	      type="html">manual</ulink> to find out how to change the menu 
	    contents.
	  </para>
	  <para>The middle mouse button (or Shift + left click) opens a list of

	    application by clicking on its menu entry.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Window Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The window manager is responsible for placing the windows on
	    the screen and provides the window borders and decorations. It
	    allows you to move windows around by draggin the titlebar and
	    provides title bar buttons, for example to close, minimize or
	    maximize a window. Look at the <ulink url="xfwm4.html"
	      type="html">manual</ulink> for a full explanation of the window 
	    manager.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Settings Manager</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The settings manager runs in the background and makes sure
	    that all Xfce 4 applications update their settings when the user 
	    changes something in the settings manager dialog (see following
	    section) and takes care of reading the configuration from disk at 
	    startup.	    
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Common Tasks</title>

    <para>This section will explain how to perform several common tasks to 
      quickly get you started working with Xfce 4. Because that is what
      Xfce 4 is designed for, to allow you to get work done.
    </para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Running programs</title>

      <variablelist>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Xfce 4 panel</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The panel is designed to allow quick access to the most
	      frequently used applications by putting them on the main panel.
	      Less often used applications can be put in a panel menu. 
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Desktop menu</term>
	  <listitem>

	  <term>Run dialog</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you know the name of a program and it is not on the panel
	      or in the desktop menu you can use the run dialog. To open the
	      dialog type Alt-F2 or choose the 'Run
	      program...' option from the desktop menu.
	    </para>
	    <para>The dialog will remeber the 10 last commands that were
	      successfully executed.
	    </para>	      
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

      </variablelist>

      <title>Managing windows and workspaces</title>

      <variablelist>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Basic window operations</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You can move windows around the screen by dragging their
	      title bar. A window can be closed, hidden, maximized, shaded and
	      made sticky &mdash; this means it will show up on all workspaces
	      &mdash; by using the title bar buttons.
	    </para>
	    <para>Right clicking on the title bar will open a menu that gives
	      access to all window operations.</para>
	    <para>Shading a window, which means collapsing it to only show the
	      title bar, can also be accomplished by using the mouse wheel
	      over the title bar. Up is shade, down is unshade.
	    </para>
	    <para>If you want maximized windows to not cover the entire screen
	      you can set workspace margins from the settings manager dialog
	      (see below).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Application management</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>To find out what applications are currently running you can
	      look at the taskbar. Clicking on a button in the taskbar will
	      focus the associated application. Clicking again will hide it.
	    </para>
	    <para>When you click with the middle mouse button on the desktop 
	      background a list of windows is shown, ordered by workspace. 
	      You can activate the application or change workspaces by 
	      choosing the appropriate menu entry.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <application>xfce4-iconbox</application> application can 
	      also be used to keep track of running applications.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Workspaces</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You can change workspaces by clicking on them in the
	      graphical pager, either on the taskbar or on the panel. Pressing 
	      Ctrl-Alt-LeftArrow or Ctrl-Alt-RightArrow will cycle through the
	      workspaces. Using the mousewheel over the pager or the desktop
	      background will have the same effect.
	    </para>
	    <para>To add or remove workspaces you can use the middle click
	      desktop menu or the settings dialog (see below).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

      </variablelist>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Using the settings manager dialog</title>

      <para>The settings manager dialog provides access to the global
	preferences of many Xfce 4 applications. You can run it by pressing 
	its laucher on the panel, from the desktop mouse menu or by running
	<application>xfce-setting-show</application>.
      </para>

      <para>Dialogs to change many aspects of the Xfce 4 desktop 
	environment are available. See the separate manuals of the Xfce 4 
	components for more information. It may be interesting to have a quick
	look at all the dialogs to find out what options are available that
	allow you to create the best possible working environment.

    </para>

    <para>Xfce 4 depends on pkg-config, GTK+ >= 2.2, libxml2 and, 
      for xffm, on libdbh, which is available from 
      <ulink url="http://sf.net/projects/libdbh" 
	type="html">SourceForge</ulink>. If you installed these from a binary
      package, make sure you have the corresponding <filename>-dev</filename>
      packages installed as well.
    </para>

    <para>Optionally you can install librsvg >= 2.2, for SVG icon support, and
      libstartup-notification, to have a busy cursor when loading applications
      that support this standard.
    </para> 

    <para>If you install into a different prefix from pkg-config, you have to
      set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to include the path to the *.pc files
      installed by the Xfce 4 libraries, which is ${prefix}/lib/pkgconfig. For
      example:
    </para>

<programlisting>export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig</programlisting>

    <para>All source tarballs also contain a so called spec file that allows
      you to build your own rpm's:
<programlisting>rpmbuild -ta <filename>module-x.y.z.tar.gz</filename></programlisting>
    </para>
