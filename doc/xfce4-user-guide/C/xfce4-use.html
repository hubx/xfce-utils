      Use <strong class="application"><code>startxfce4</code></strong> to start an Xfce session, which
      includes the session manager, the panel, the window manager and the 
      desktop manager.
    </p><p>
      By default the Xfce session manager manages the startup of applications. 
      It allows you to save your session when you quit Xfce, so that the next 
      time you log in, the same applications will be started for you 
      automatically.
    </p><p>
      To customize the behaviour of <strong class="application"><code>startxfce4</code></strong>, 
      copy the file <code class="filename">${sysconfdir}/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc</code> to 
      your personal <code class="filename">~/.config/xfce4/</code> 
      directory and edit that file.  Depending on your installation method the 
      location of the system <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> file may be 
      different. If you install from source, 
      <code class="filename">${sysconfdir}</code> defaults to 
      <code class="filename">/usr/local/etc/</code>. For binary 
      packages it is often set to 
      <code class="filename">/etc/</code>, 
      <code class="filename">/etc/X11</code>,
      <code class="filename">/usr/pkg/etc</code> or
      <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/etc</code>;
      you can use your package manager to find out.

      funtionality, but rather it tries to adhere to the old UNIX tradition of 
      small tools that do one job and do it well. A default Xfce desktop with no 
      applications running is shown in <a href="xfce4-use.html#default-session-fig" title="Figure 1. Default Xfce 4 session">Figure 1, &#8220;Default Xfce 4 session&#8221;</a>.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="default-session-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. Default Xfce 4 session</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/default-session.png" alt="Default Xfce session, with desktop manager and panel."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
      When you run <strong class="application"><code>startxfce4</code></strong> for the first
      time, several applications are started by the Xfce session manager:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Panel</span></dt><dd><p>
            In a default session there is a full width panel at the top of the 
            screen and a smaller one at the bottom. The 
            <strong class="application"><code>xfce4-panel</code></strong> application manages all 
            panels on the screen.
          </p><p>
            The top panel shows a graphical pager with a miniature view of all
            workspaces, a task list showing all applications running on the 
            current workspace and a system tray to show status icons that are 
            used for example by some media players or instant messaging 
            applications.
	  </p><p>
            The bottom panel contains several application launchers and a clock.
            You can right-click on any panel item to get a menu that allows you 
            to change its properties, add or remove new items or to change the
            properties of the panel itself.
	  </p><p>
            For more information, have a look at the 
            <a href="xfce4-panel.html" target="_top">panel manual</a>.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop Manager</span></dt><dd><p>
            The desktop manager provides the desktop background image and two 
            menus when you click on the desktop background. Optionally, it can 
            show icons on the desktop, either for minimized applications or for 
            files in the <code class="filename">~/Desktop</code> folder.
	  </p><p>
            The right mouse button opens a menu that allows you to start 
	    applications. Look at the 
            <a href="xfdesktop.html" target="_top">manual</a> to find out how to change the 
            menu contents.
	  </p><p>The middle mouse button (or Shift + left click) opens a list of
	    all applications that are currently running. You can activate an
	    application by clicking on its menu entry.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Window Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The window manager is responsible for placing the windows on
	    the screen and provides the window borders and decorations. It
	    allows you to move windows around by draggin the titlebar and
	    provides title bar buttons, for example to close, minimize or
	    maximize a window. Look at the 
            <a href="xfwm4.html" target="_top">manual</a> for a full 
            explanation of the window manager settings.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Settings Manager</span></dt><dd><p>
            The settings manager runs in the background and makes sure that all
            Xfce applications update their settings when the user changes 
            something in the settings manager dialog (see following section) and
            it takes care of reading the configuration from disk at startup. 
            Have a look at the <a href="xfce-mcs-manager.html" target="_top">Settings Manager</a> and <a href="xfce-mcs-plugins.html" target="_top">Settings Plugins</a>
            manuals for a full explanation of the settings manager.

      quickly get you started working with Xfce 4. Because that is what
      Xfce 4 is designed for, to allow you to get work done.

	      Less often used applications can be put in a launcher menu.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop Menu</span></dt><dd><p>Another method for starting applications is from the desktop

              If you know the name of a program and it is not on the panel
	      or in the desktop menu you can use the run dialog. To open the
	      dialog type <span><strong class="keycap">Alt+F2</strong></span> or choose the <span><strong class="guilabel">Run
	      program...</strong></span> option from the desktop menu.

	      title bar. A window can be closed, hidden, maximized, shaded and
	      made sticky &#8212; this means it will show up on all workspaces
	      &#8212; by using the title bar buttons.
	    </p><p>Right clicking on the title bar will open a menu that gives
	      access to all window operations.</p><p>Shading a window, which means collapsing it to only show the
	      title bar, can also be accomplished by using the mouse wheel
	      over the title bar. Mouse wheel up is shade, mouse wheel down 
              is unshade.
	    </p><p>If you want maximized windows to not cover the entire screen
	      you can set workspace margins from the settings manager dialog
	      (see below).
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Application management</span></dt><dd><p>To find out what applications are currently running you can
	      look at the task list on the top panel. Clicking on a button in 
              the task list will focus the associated application. Clicking 
              again will hide it.
	    </p><p>When you click with the middle mouse button on the desktop 
	      background a list of windows is shown, ordered by workspace. 
	      You can activate the application or change workspaces by 
	      choosing the appropriate menu entry.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Workspaces</span></dt><dd><p>You can change workspaces by clicking on them in the

	      <span><strong class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow</strong></span> or
              <span><strong class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow</strong></span> will cycle through the
	      workspaces. Using the mousewheel over the pager or the desktop
	      background has the same effect.

        launcher on the panel, from the desktop mouse menu or by running
	<strong class="application"><code>xfce-setting-show</code></strong>.
      </p><p>Dialogs to change many aspects of the Xfce Desktop Environment are 
        available. See the separate manuals of the Xfce components for more

        the best possible working environment.
